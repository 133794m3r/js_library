The functions in here are self explanatory. All files in here are licensed
under the LGPLv3 or higher, except shortcut.js which is under the BSD license.

Also please note that sql.js isn't completely stable when using anything but the localStorage interface for getting data. I've not coded anything else for it and doubt I will for quite some time. The rest of the functions should work just fine.
